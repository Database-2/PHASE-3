PHASE 2 OF TWITTER LIKE DATABASE
Programmers: Emmanuel Rosario and Brett Lundy

For this web database assignment it is preferable that the user/grader would start by opening the login 
  page, but the site is designed to take you to the login page from every other page, if there is no 
  logged in user. We decided to implement this by using a series of php documents some of which have 
  HTML code in the same file as the php file and some that have either the HTML code embedded in the php
  or the php code embedded into the HTML.

The first five queries for the assignment can be found on the right hand side in the blue box on the home 
  page right after logging in. Query six can be found by clicking the inbox button on the left hand side 
  of every page. The seventh query can be found on the home page. The eighth query can be found on the 
  home page; enter the name of the user you want to follow in the search bar then click search and then
  click follow or unfollow. The ninth query can be foundon either the home or profile pages. The tenth 
  query can be found on the profile page.
