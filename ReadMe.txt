PHASE 3 OF TWITTER LIKE DATABASE
Programmers: Emmanuel Rosario and Brett Lundy

For this web database assignment it is preferable that the user/grader would start by opening the login 
  page, but the app is designed to take you to the login page from every other page, if there is no 
  logged in user. We decided to implement this by using a series of if statements. In order for our app 
  to run correctly the grader will have to store all the php files into (localhost storage)\PHASE-3\PHASE-3\php_files\.

The first five queries for the assignment can be found on the right hand corner in the menu box on the login 
  page. Query six can be found by clicking the inbox button on the right hand side corner message icon 
  of home page. The seventh query can be found on the home page right after logging in. We only had time to
  do the first seven queries, but we feel as though that is enough since we only had to do two queries from 
  the first five queries and two from the last five queries. We also allow you to see all posts on the home 
  page and reply to and delete messages in your inbox. You can also send a message to a user without it being 
  a reply. Lastly we also made it so that people can not only login but also sign up.
